# Detect Cell Division

This is a complex image classification problem with the help of neural networks.

Goal: The program can detect if there is a cell division or not on each images.

I annotated 936.600 images manually.

There is a lot of data, so optimalization is a key factor.

First, i built a convolutional neural network.

# Plans

Try to get better and better scores with each neural network.

Create a convolutional neural network, then a recurrent neural network, and check how they perform.

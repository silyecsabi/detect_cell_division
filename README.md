# Tetect Cell Division

This is an ML/DL Project. 

Goal: The program can detect if there is a cell division or not in the images with the help of neural networks.

I annotated 936.600 60x60 images manually, alone.

First, i built a fully connected neural network.

# Plans

Try to get better and better scores with each neural network.

Create a convolutional neural network, then a recurrent neural network, and check how they perform.
